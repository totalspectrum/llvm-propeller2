 *
 * Time zones are given as strings of the form
 * "[TZNAME][h][:m][TZDSTNAME]" where h:m gives the hours:minutes
 * east of GMT for the timezone (if [:m] does not appear, 0 is assumed).
 * If the final field, TZDSTNAME, appears, then the time zone follows

 * Example: EST5EDT would represent the N. American Eastern time zone

 *          NFLD3:30NFLD would represent Newfoundland time (one and a

 *          OZCST-9:30 would represent the Australian central time zone.

 * NOTE: support for daylight savings time is currently very bogus.
