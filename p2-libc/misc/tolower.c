/* from dLibs v1.2, by Dale Schumacher */
/* 
  I'd like to see these routines distributed as widely as possible as I
feel they will be a benefit to many people.  The only restriction I'd
like to place on the use of dLibs is this.  If you modify the source
code, please don't redistribute it under the name "dLibs".  I encourage
people to look at, play with, modify and improve the source code as
much as they want, and would gladly accept suggestions (preferrably
with source code) for changes/additions to dLibs.  I simply want to
avoid the problem of digressive versions of dLibs.
